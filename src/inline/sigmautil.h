/*  Given some data, current clipping bounds calculated by  sigma  clipping,
 *  and  some  parameters,  calculate the new clipping bounds that should be
 *  used  for  the  next  round  of  sigma  clipping.  This  is   calculated
 *  independently for each of the eight lanes of the vectors in the data and
 *  the vectors in the clipping bounds. Each lane of vector_count floats  in
 *  the  data vector array represent a group of numbers to be sigma clipped,
 *  and each lane of the vectors in the result represent  the  new  clipping
 *  bounds of the corresponding group of numbers in the input.
 *  
 *      ** data
 *    array of 8 groups of vector_count floats to be clipped (1 lane per group)
 *      ** vector_count
 *    size of the groups to be clipped, including those out of the bounds
 *      ** bounds
 *  clipping bounds used in the  previous  iteration.  Only  numbers  within
 *  these  bounds  (inclusive)  are  considered  in calculating the standard
 *  deviation and new clipping bounds.
 *      ** center
 *    center used for calculating the new bounds
 *      ** clipped_count
 *  count of numbers in each lane that are within the range defined  by  the
 *  bounds parameter. Although this function could internally determine this
 *  vector, the caller is responsible for calculating this vector  to  speed
 *  up the function.
 *      ** sigma_lower
 *    vector of 4 identical positive doubles
 *      ** sigma_upper
 *    vector of 4 identical positive doubles
 *  
 *  The new clipping range is defined as [center - sigma_lower * s, center +
 *  sigma_upper  *  s],  where  sd  is  calculated as the standard deviation
 *  treating center as the mean of the data (which it doesn't have  to  be).
 *  However,  if  the  new clipping bounds are not entirely contained within
 *  the old clipping bounds (i.e., the new lower bound  is  lower  than  the
 *  previous lower bound or the new upper bound is higher than the new upper
 *  bound), then the new bounds will be  adjusted  to  fit  within  the  old
 *  bounds (using min and max).
